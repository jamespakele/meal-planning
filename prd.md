## User Stories

### Primary User (Household Manager)

2. "As someone managing a busy household, I want to receive immediate notifications when family members complete their meal preferences so I can finalize plans quickly."
3. "As the primary shopper, I want my shopping list automatically organized by store sections and separated into staples vs. recipe-specific items, with quantities calculated for my specific household groups."
4. "As a meal planner, I want to set group-level dietary restrictions once (like 'no tomato paste for Whole House' or 'no nuts for Just Kids') and have all meal suggestions automatically respect those constraints."

### Secondary User (Family Member)
1. "As a busy nurse working double shifts, I want to quickly select meal preferences for groups I'm part of ('Adults Only', 'Whole House') on my phone during breaks."
2. "As a teenager, I want to add special requests for 'Just Kids' meals so my preferences are considered when parents aren't eating with us."
3. "As a family member, I want to see only meal options that work for the groups I'm in, automatically filtered for our group's dietary restrictions."
4. "As a parent, I want to influence both 'Whole House' and 'Wife and Kids' meal selections since those groups affect my family differently."
